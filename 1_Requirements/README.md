## Introduction 

The heat control system is basically used to control the temperature of a car seat. When a user or driver of the car gets seated on a car, the button sensor gets activated. After that, the user gets access to turn on the heater. The temperature sensor keeps monitoring the temperature and sends the analog value to the microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the analog input of the temperature sensor and outputs a temperature value through serial communication. All the activities of the control system are done on a microcontroller called Atmega328.

## Research

In the past few years, the need for automation has increased and has been widely applied for measuring heating systems. There are plenty of commercial temperature control systems which can be bought from manufacturers or from inventors, and also, quite a lot of work have been published in this area. Our work is similar to the work it measure value as a persons seatimg for an hours and driving based on that temperature measure diplayed in oscilloscope, the control measure has been implementated in variour methods like ventilator seat to overcome the heat of seat. But it differs in the sense that, our work take into account, the ease of programming the microcontroller and user-friendliness by using keypad to enter a reference value.

Login, Can Change Price of a Ticket, Can View the Reserved Tickets, Exit System, User, Login with Credatials, View the Movies Avaliable, Purchase a Ticket, View the avaliable seats, Cancel a Ticket and Exit System.


## 4W's and 1'H
## Who
*   People wish to book the ticket to watch in theater
## What

*   To bulid a system to book ticket,cancel ticket,view reserverd seats,change price of ticket(only admin)

## When

*   When user wants to carry out the tasks quickly and this reduces manual work and saves time

## Where

*   This issue is in all parts of the world in theater where there is a lot of booking,cancellation of tickets happening in all the time

## How

*   By creating a system which will provide all the functionalities required,the booking of, cancelling of the tickes and other actions will be take more time and system needs more workers for these actions
